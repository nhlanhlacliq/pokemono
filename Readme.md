##pokemon game created for learning about classes

TO-DO
-After experimenting with your Classes, go back to your methods and add some logic to deal with edge cases that you might not have thought about. Here are a couple of examples that you could try to implement:
     
    -A potion should not be able to heal a Pokémon past its maximum health.
    -A Pokémon that is knocked out should not be able to attack another Pokémon.
    -A trainer should not be able to switch their active Pokémon to one that is knocked out
    -As you continue to test your Classes, there may be other edge cases you encounter that you might want to fix.

-Add more functionality that we haven’t implemented yet. Here is a list of ideas that you might want to try:

    -Give Pokémon experience for battling other Pokémon. A Pokémon’s level should increase once it gets enough experience points.
    -Create specific Classes that inherit from the general Pokémon class. For example, could you create a Charmander class that has all of the functionality of a Pokémon plus some     extra features? 
    -Let your Pokémon evolve once they hit a certain level.
    -Have more stats associated with a Pokémon. In the real game, every Pokémon has stats like Speed, Attack, Defense. All of those stats effect the way Pokemon battle with each       other. For example, the Pokémon with the larger Speed stat will go first in the battle.
